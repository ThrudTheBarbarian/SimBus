- Modify the termination/trigger conditions
    - remove 'clocks' from the last option, it's redundant
    - add an 'until signal' option so we can wait on a plugin

- Plugins should be able to configure whether they have a settings wheel

- Add a vertical-line cursor which tracks across all the signals, like a
  clock-indicator line but brighter
    - Have another splitview on the RHS which shows the value at cursor
    - Make cursor 'snap' when within 2 pix ofsignal change, at signal that
      mouse is over, unless dX for signal is < 4 pix.
    - eventually allow seek (using arrow keys) for next change for signal
      that mouse is on, or could also be buttons on RHS screen

 - Add save/load project, also default project to load
 
* Signal vertical offsets between modules isn't working

* Need test harness module, to exercise A,D,R/W for example

* Still need ns timings on signals view

* Signal expansion ought to be based on the module, not the signal, otherwise
  all duplicate modules will expand their signal at once

* Once there are enough signals that we need a scrollbar, the module display
  needs to shrink its width, so the scrollbar has space
