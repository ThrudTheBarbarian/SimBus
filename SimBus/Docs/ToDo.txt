- Modify the termination/trigger conditions
    - remove 'clocks' from the last option, it's redundant
    - add an 'until signal' option so we can wait on a plugin

- Signal vertical offsets between modules isn't working

- Need test harness module, to exercise A,D,R/W for example

- Plugins should be able to configure whether they have a settings wheel

- Still need ns timings on signals view

* Signal expansion ought to be based on the module, not the signal, otherwise
  all duplicate modules will expand their signal at once

* Once there are enough signals that we need a scrollbar, the module display
  needs to shrink its width, so the scrollbar has space
